The chatbot is able to teach project management fundamentals to students from different disciplines. It can be integrated in project management courses or in more general management courses. We pilot it in our courses and conduct research on its user experiences. By providing concrete guidelines and templates also teachers from other fields can develop their own subject specific chatbots. Based on this research we aim to establish pedagogical guidelines for using educational chatbots in higher education online courses.\""
